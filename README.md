## My Personal Portfolio

<img src="/public/images/my_portfolio.png">

## Description

* Greetings and welcome to the repo for my personal web dev portfolio. I built out my portfolio using JavaScript and React as well as incorporating a (new to me) React Framework known as [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/). I decided to implement NextJS due to its ability of smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and little to no configuration needed.
